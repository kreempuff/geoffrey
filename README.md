# Geoffrey 

Geoffrey is a automation tool inspired by Jenkins, and named 
after [Geoffrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marcell) of **The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air**.

First things first, Rest in Peace to Uncle Phil.

This project is motivated in large part due to the frustration felt 
with some of the CI/CD tools out there. Here's hoping this is 
different.
